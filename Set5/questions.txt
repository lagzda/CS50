0.  It is the longest english word and means a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.
1.  getrusage() returns usage measures for either the calling process, children of calling process or the calling thread.
2.  In the struct rusage there are 16 members.
3.  The getrusage expects a pointer to be passed in and using pointers is also more efficient.  
4.  The for loop reads every character of the input.
    Then it checks if the character is alhabetical or if it is an apostrophe somewhere other than the start of the word
    If it is it appends the character to the word variable at the index position and increments index.
    It also checks if the word doesn't exceed the maximum length of the word which is 45 and discards it if it does.
    If a number is found in a word discard the word as well.
    Discarding it means to set the index back to zero and move the pointer in the input to EOF
    If the character is not alphanumerical we have found the end of the word.
    EOF is added for the word, word count is incremented, and spell check is performed along with function benchmarking.
    When done index is set to 0 to prepare for the new word.
5.  By using fgetc instead of fscanf we can examine each character more effectively as well as keep count of characters
    as to not cause segmentation errors when reading words longer than the maximum size allowed for word.
6.  Const type is used because it points to a datatype that is not modifiable as in this case check and load functions
    only need to read the data not rewrite or write to it.
