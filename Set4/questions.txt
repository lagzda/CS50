0.  JPEG: 24 bit color palette = ~16.7 million colors
    PNG: 24 bit color palette = ~16.7 million colors
    GIF: 8 bit color palette = 256 colors
    BMP: 32 bit color palette = ~4.3 billion colors 
1.  Animation is supported by GIF file format
2.  Lossless compression is the compression of a file where all data is recoverable
    when uncompressed.Lossy compression on the other hand permanently erases certain 
    information of the file.
3.  JPEG is lossy compressed.
4.  On FAT (File Allocation Table) a file deletion means deleting the address of the file
    instead of the actual file.
5.  I would delete files by replacing each bit in the disk by a 0 bit.
6.  The stdint.h is a header file that declares sets of integer types with fixed
    width (size in bits) and defines their corresponding macros (functions).
7.  On different machines an INT, CHAR, SHORT... can represent different bit sizes. 
    int[n]_t and uint[n]_t are constant size INTs regardless of the machine. It is
    an alias for whatever INT type a specific system considers of size n.
8.  BYTE = 1 byte, 
    WORD = 2 bytes, 
    DWORD = 4 bytes, 
    LONG = signed 4 bytes.
9.  ASCI = BM,
    HEX = 0x42 0x4D
    DEC = 66 77
