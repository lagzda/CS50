0.  JPEG: 24 bit color palette = ~16.7 million colors
    PNG: 24 bit color palette = ~16.7 million colors
    GIF: 8 bit color palette = 256 colors
    BMP: 32 bit color palette = ~4.3 billion colors 
1.  Animation is supported by GIF file format
2.  Lossless compression is the compression of a file where all data is recoverable
    when uncompressed.Lossy compression on the other hand permanently erases certain 
    information of the file.
3.  JPEG is lossy compressed.
4.  On FAT (File Allocation Table) a file deletion means deleting the address of the file
    instead of the actual file.
5.  I would delete files by replacing each bit in the disk by a 0 bit.
6.  The stdint.h is a header file that declares sets of integer types with fixed
    width (size in bits) and defines their corresponding macros (functions).
7.  On different machines an INT, CHAR, SHORT... can represent different bit sizes. 
    int[n]_t and uint[n]_t are constant size INTs regardless of the machine. It is
    an alias for whatever INT type a specific system considers of size n.
8.  BYTE = 1 byte, 
    WORD = 2 bytes, 
    DWORD = 4 bytes, 
    LONG = signed 4 bytes.
9.  ASCI = BM,
    HEX = 0x42 0x4D,
    DEC = 66 77.
10. BfSize is the size of the whole file
    BiSize is the size of the struct BITMAPINFOHEADER
11. A negative BiHeight means that the image file is top-down instead of bottom-up
12. Color depth is just how many bits for color a pixel has and it is represented
    by biBitCount
13. fopen write might return NULL if there is not enough memory to allocate for a file 
    or there is not a permission to create the file.
14. The third argument of fread is called nmemb and it specifies how many elements
    the program should attemp to read. If it reaches EOF before the specified
    bytes are read it simply returns 0. So in copy.c it is used to make sure that 
    the element with the exactly specified size is read.
15. biWidth indicates how many pixels wide is the image. Since a scanline must
    be a multiple of 4 the following function calculates the padding needed.
    int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4;
    (4 - (3 * 3) % 4) % 4;
    (4 - 9 % 4) % 4;
    (4 - 1) % 4;
    3 % 4 = 3;
    The padding needs to be 3 bytes if biWidth = 3.
16. fseek sets the file stream pointer called stream to the specified offset.
    The function has three arguments. The first is the pointer that we will move 
    to the offset, the second is the offset itself, and the third is the location
    from which the offset needs to be measured. 
17. SEEK_CUR indicates the current file pointer position. It is used for example
    if I want to move by some offset from the current position in my file.
